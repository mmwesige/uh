                <p><strong> Dependency – Detoxification Treatment </strong><br>
                    Frequent use of drugs and alcohol can result in physical dependence, 
                    and when individuals stop using drugs and alcohol abruptly, they often experience severe withdrawal symptoms. 
                    Our inpatient detoxification program ensures safe withdrawal and the beginning of the recovery cycle.
                    Patients are detoxified under the care of a psychiatrist, nurses, social workers, and psychologists
                    who provide medication, monitoring, and support during the withdrawal process. <br>
                    Additional treatment includes group therapies and activities throughout the day to address the disease of addiction. 
                    To ensure continued success when the patient leaves the hospital, we create discharge plan outlines with the patient and family for appropriate follow-up care.<br>
                    <br><strong>Recovery WORKS – Intensive Outpatient Program</strong><br>
                    Recovery WORKS is an intensive outpatient program for adults struggling with drug and alcohol problems. 
                    Patients work in a group therapy setting four nights a week for eight weeks. <br>
                    To ensure success after completion of treatment, continued weekly aftercare support is available for participants.<br>
                    The treatment team includes a board certified addiction psychiatrist, 
                    licensed clinical social workers, licensed substance abuse counsellors, and expressive therapists. <br>
                    The program incorporates some components of the philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous 
                    along with cognitive behaviour treatment (CBT) and mindfulness techniques. <br> 
                    Participants are expected to attend 12 Step meetings or other community sober support group.
                    The family's participation in the family group is essential to the program, held once a week. 
                    Experiential therapy, which includes art and music therapy and 
                    ROPES challenge course activities, are also integrated into the program weekly. <br>
                    To be included in Recovery WORKS, individuals must be medically clear and detoxified from alcohol and drugs. 
                    Regular attendance is required. <br>
